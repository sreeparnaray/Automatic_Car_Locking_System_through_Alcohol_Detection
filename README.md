# Automatic_Car_Locking_System_through_Alcohol_Detection
This project presents the design and implementation of an Alcohol Detection and Engine Locking System for cars and other vehicles using an Arduino Nano as the MCU (Master Control Unit) and a MQ3 Sensor as the detection device for alcohol. The system continuously monitors the alcohol level in its affinity using the MQ3 sensor, and as soon as the concentration of alcohol goes beyond the threshold level, the engine gets locked and a buzzer starts to beep/buzz to give indication to the nearby vehicles that the particular vehicleâ€™s driver is drunk and it is not safe to drive nearby the vehicle, and is a threat to other people on the road.
